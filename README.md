# International Debt Statistics Analysis

The International Debt Report (IDR), formerly International Debt Statistics (IDS), is a longstanding annual publication of the World Bank featuring external debt statistics and analysis for the 121 low- and middle-income countries that report to the World Bank Debt Reporting System (DRS).

We are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. 



I have used Postgre SQL for the analysis of the data.

## Overview

A government or a company will want to borrow from an overseas lender for a variety of reasons. One reason is  that local debt markets may not be capable of  meeting their financing needs, especially in developing countries. Additionally, foreign lenders may simply offer more favorable terms. For countries with low income, in particular, borrowing from foreign institutions is a necessary choice since it will provide financing that it would otherwise not be able to obtain at competitive rates and flexible periods of repayment.

The World Bank is the organization that provides debt to countries.

We are going to analyze the international debt data collected by the World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. We are going to find the followings:

* What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries * listed in the dataset?
* Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
* What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
